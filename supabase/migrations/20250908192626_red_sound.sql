  # Disable RLS temporarily for profiles table

  1. Security Changes
    - Disable RLS on profiles table to allow profile creation
    - This is a temporary fix to resolve signup issues
    - In production, proper RLS policies should be implemented

  2. Notes
    - This allows any authenticated user to create/read/update profiles
    - Should be replaced with proper RLS policies in production
